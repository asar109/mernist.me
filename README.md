## 🔍 About Me

Welcome to **Mernist** 👋

I’m a firm believer that passion knows no bounds. My journey from a **BBA graduate** to a self-taught **Full Stack Developer** is a testament to my curiosity and drive to build.

Over the past two years, I’ve delivered production-ready, scalable web applications using the **MERN stack**. Whether it's a feature-rich admin dashboard, a real-time chat app, or a landing page with scroll-triggered animations — I build things that solve real problems.
